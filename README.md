## Security

All local state is persisted with AES-256-GCM encryption (Web Crypto API). Data stored on disk appears as opaque ciphertext rather than plaintext JSON, protecting against casual inspection and generic malware. Production builds targeting high-assurance environments should migrate to `@tauri-apps/plugin-stronghold` for OS-keychain-backed storage.

## Development

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for setup instructions.

```bash
pnpm dev          # web dev server (localhost:5173)
pnpm tauri:dev    # Tauri desktop dev window
pnpm build        # production web build
pnpm tauri:build  # production desktop binary
```
